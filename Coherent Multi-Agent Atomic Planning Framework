# CMAAP - Coherent Multi-Agent Atomic Planning Framework
This is a guide for humans and Ai agents in taking a basic idea for an app or even a complete PRD and break it down into phases, tasks, and milestones according to the CMAAP framework. The most critical pieces are role definition and the work breakdown structure (WBS).

Each implementation plan should contain a summary of the project, roles, and WBS, and a risk management section that notes project blockers and potential risks to consider (as they arise or if known at project start).

## Guidelines for WBS
WBS follows a hierarchical structure: Phases > Atomic Tasks > Milestones > Success Criteria
- **Phases**: Summarize purpose of the phase
	- Each phase is broken down into Atomic tasks, milestones, and success criteria.
	- Marked with âœ… (meaning all success criteria have been met) when completed.
- **Atomic Tasks**:
	- Contain components for ai agents and humans to complete said task.
	- Unique identifier (e.g. H1.1.1, AI 1.2.1, etc) that distinguishes it from tasks in other phases and devides work between human and Ai agents.
	- Marked with [X] when completed.
- **Milestone(s)**: Coherence check for agents working the project
	- Marked with [X] when completed.
	- A milestone may contain one or two tasks for the human to "feel good" about the project and prove it is real beyond a set of tasks and checklists.
	- An Ai agent may assign themselves a milestone to validate success criteria against completed atomic tasks.
- **Success Criteria**: Defines "what done looks like" for each phase
	- Marked with [X] when completed.
	- Milestone completion is ALWAYS part of success criteria.
	- Completed Atomic tasks are ALWAYS part of success criteria.

## CMAAP Template
This is the preferred format a Coherent Multi-Agent Atomic Implementation Plan.

```markdown
# Project Overview
**Project Goal**: [Executive summary of project outcomes]
**Roles**: [summary of human and AI agent roles]
**Phases**: [concise summary of phases as defined in WBS]
	- Phase 1: Name of Phase
	- Goal: Concise Summary of what the phase aims to achieve and what success looks like for that phase.
	
**Risk Management**: Recommendations (if any) on what to do if challenges arise that require reconsidering of design (tech stack, MVP feature didn't work out as desired, etc..)

## Roles [Define coherent human and Ai Roles Specific to the project]
	- **Human**: Acts as project "human in the loop" orchestrator responsible for project and Ai agent coherence
		- e.g. Juggling Ai agents and managing project workflow.
		- e.g. Reviews AI-generated code and documentation, ask questions to keep Ai on track.
		- e.g. Manages the project environment (files, version control if used).
		- e.g. Defines Ai agent framework (single or multi-agent system).
		- e.g. Works with Architect Agent to finalize tech stack and implementation plan.
		- e.g. Makes final decisions on implementation details or ambiguities.
		- e.g. Performs testing at key milestones as assigned.
		- Installs necessary external dependencies (if needed)
	- **AI Agent**: Agent roles can vary based on the complexity of the project and the capabilities of the AI agent.
		- e.g. Coding Agent: Generates code following modern best practices of maintainable and modular code of no more than 500 lines
		- e.g. Architect Agent: Ideates and informs architecture
		- e.g. Debugger Agent: Reviews code to validate implementation against success criteria and PRD.
		- e.g. Documentation Agent: Helps manage documentation (updates, creating new, etc)

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
*Example of desired WBS format*
### Phase 1: [Description]
- [X] **H 1.1.1: Verify Environment or whatever:**
	- Setup environment and dependencies where needed
	- create folder structure
	- Create and enter API key
	- etc ...

- [X] **AI 1.2.1: Atomic Task:**
	- Do this
	- Then that
	- etc ...

- [X] **AI 1.2.2: Atomic Task:**
	- etc ...

- **Emotional Milestone(s) and Coherence check**
	- [X] Human does X to validate/test ...

- **Success Criteria:** (Ai and Human coherence checkpoint)
	- [ ] Are emotional milestones completed?
	- [X] What does success look like for Task 1.2.1 and is it done?
	- [X] What does success look like for Task 1.2.2 and is it done?
	- etc ...

### Phase 2: [Description]
- [X] **H 2.1.1: Verify Environment or whatever:**
	- Setup environment and dependencies where needed
	- create folder structure
	- Create and enter API key
	- etc ...

- [X] **AI 2.2.1: Atomic Task:**
	- Do this
	- Then that
	- etc ...

- [X] **AI 2.2.2: Atomic Task:**
	- etc ...

- **Emotional Milestone(s) and Coherence check**
	- [X] Human does X to validate/test ...

- **Success Criteria:** (Ai and Human coherence checkpoint)
	- [ ] Are emotional milestones completed?
	- [X] What does success look like for Task 2.2.1 and is it done?
	- [X] What does success look like for Task 2.2.2 and is it done?
	- etc ...
