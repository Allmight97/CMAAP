# CMAAP - Coherent Multi-Agent Atomic Planning Framework

This is a work in progress and will change over time as my knowledge and experience grows and as Ai systems become more advanced, 

#GOAL - helping humans help Ai (help humans)

To create a framework in the form of a template that a person could use in conjunction with any of the modern AI agent coding tools (Windsurf, Cursor, Augment, RooCode, Cline, Claude Code, etc) to define an implementation plan that a human and AI could follow and use as a basic project tracker. At first this was intended to be a simple framework to act as a template to guide any AI to create an implementation plan with role definitions structured the way I found works best for me. However, I've seen the value in expanding this out a little further to also act as a means to define AI agent roles that could be used in any number of multi-agent systems.

#FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

In more complex multi-agent setups, this could be adapted within a system prompt for an AI Archtiect role in any number of modern Ai services or even within more complex multi-agent (Google ADK, Autogen, LangChain, etc) setups using.

#EXAMPLE USE CASE

Say you worked with your favorite AI service (Gemini or Claude or ChatGPT) to get your basic smooth-brained idea out of your skull into a decently formatted PRD (what you envision the thing to do). You then chat with your AI agent of choice to flesh out that PRD into an implementation plan that aligns with the CMAAP framework so that the bloody machine produces a somewhat reliable planning doc, thus destroying Planet Druidia (old ways) and saving Planet Spaceball (ain't nobody got time for all this planning and coding).

PS: BLAAAAT!
