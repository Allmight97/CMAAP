Framework for Coherent Multi-Agent Atomic Implementation Planning

The goal of this project is to create a framework in the form of a template that a person could use in conjunction with any of the modern AI agent coding tools (Windsurf, Cursor, Augment, RooCode, Cline, Claude Code, etc) to define an implementation plan that a human and AI could follow and use as a basic project tracker. At first this was intended to be a simple framework to act as a template to guide any AI to create an implementation plan with role definitions structured the way I found works best for me. However, I've seen the value in expanding this out a little further to also act as a means to define AI agent roles that could be used in any number of multi-agent systems (Google ADK, Autogen, LangChain, etc).

In more complex multi-agent setups, this could be adapted to create an implementation agent role and given this framework as a definition of what the user expects to see when they are planning their project. For example, you could add this to your architect agent and when you are done planning with the agent you could have it spit out an implementation plan using this framework.
